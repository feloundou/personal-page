I'm a member of the Fall 2020 class of OpenAI scholars. I will use this as a repository for my thoughts and insights throughout the journey towards learning how to help machines learn, an endeavour supported by OpenAI. I will document my daily discoveries on my Roam notes page. You may reach out to me to get reading permissions or to share feedback.
